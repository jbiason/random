# WHAT IS THIS?!?

Any time I want to check how to do something, to figure out a solution in
isolation, I open a project in this repository.

Does it contain anything useful? That's a resounding "Maayybeee..."

Thing is, it is useful **for me**. I can figure out how to fix something
without fighting a whole project build system, I can tinker the solution in
isolation, I don't need to worry too much about breaking changes or how to fix
tests...
